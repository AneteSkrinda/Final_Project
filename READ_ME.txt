In this final project for She Goes Tech program "Python and Big Data analytics" bootcamp I looked at the data from Domestic Box Office For 2022.

Data is gathered using web scraping and analyzed using Pandas. Data is exported as a csv file and graphics are exported as png files.

As one of the last steps I saved the gathered data in the MySQL database.

Then I made SQL query that retrieves data from the data base grouped by release month.
